### Programming Robots for FRC

#### Welcome to the programming team!

 * Our job is to program the robot
 * This means we have to tell all the different motors what to do
 * We take input from both the driver controllers and sensors
 * When we are done the robot should be easy to drive
 * Most of all programming is fun!

#### What you need to know:

 * Java (up to objects and methods, polymorphism for CommandBased)
 * WPILIBJ (The library we will be working with to code the robot)
 * Parts of the robot (We will go over this.)
 * Basics on how electronics work. (PWMs carry signal... etc.)

#### Other tasks for our team:

 * safety video (3d animation using Autodesk Maya)
 * The website (HTML, we will probably spend a day or two on it
   and make a sub team responsible for it)

#### The plan:

 * Split the team up:
   - Those who know Java
   - Those who need to learn
 * Java team will program last years robot from scratch
 * The other team will learn Java
 * Both will learn all the parts on a robot (quiz maybe?)
 * Any ideas? We are open to suggestions.
 * Team names? or is that lame?

#### Leadership:

 * How should we do it
 * Does anyone even want to do it?
 * Jay and Abraham volunteered
